# Lab 3: Last In/First Out, First In/Last Out # 
**10 points**

**Due 20 February, 2018**

For this lab, you will be implementing both a *Last In/First Out* and *First In/First Out* data structures. These data structures store data in a way that allows you to only see one value from the structure. You can't see any other value in the structure unless it is the top value.
These structures are important because they allow us to add or remove data members to the structure in an O(1) complexity.

### Lab Instructions
- Write code 
 
### Hints ###
- Some of these functions are basically the same. Don't rewrite or paste code, just call the function with the altered inputs.
- Keep track of your edge cases: empty, 1 item, 2 items
