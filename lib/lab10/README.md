# Lab 10: Group Research Project # 

This assignment is a capstone to all of the skills you have learned this semester in both lecture in lab. You will have the opportunity to work in groups of 4 people to research, implement, test, and verify an algorithm or data structure that sounds interesting to you. Version control will be an important part accomplishing this becuase you will need to have multiple people working on the code to accomplish these tasks. 

This assignment is also worth more than all of your other lab assignments, 40 points. All aspects this project are important and everyone needs to contribute.

## Sections ##
This will be treated like a project you would do at job. You will need to work together with your teammates to accomplish each of the tasks, and everyone needs to understand what is going on in each of the sections.

#### Implementation ####
You will be graded on the quality of code you write for your implementation. This means that you need to have code that well thought out, variable and function names that are descriptive, and comments explain more complex portions of the code. 

Most of the topics are fairly small, so we recommend writing the implementation quickly, and then rewriting it again. The second implementation should be much easier to follow, since you will understand how the code should work. 

You need to be using version git for this project, and you will all need to be making changes, and writing meaningful commit messages. This not only will help us track your progress, but it will allow your team mates to pull the code from bitbucket and understand what has been changed, and what still needs to be done.

#### Testing and Verification ####
Your implementation also needs to be extremely well tested using Google Test. Write a lot of tests and test every single edge case you can think of. Writing tests is incredibly important for understanding what exactly you want your software to do. If you write the tests early, you can also make sure that when you make changes, you will know if the changes that you made broke your code. 

We expect more lines of tests code that we do of the implementation. There is so much that you can test that you could probably write tests for the rest of your life and still not test everything.


#### Code Review ####
On the last week of lab before the lab exam, we will do a 30 minute code review of your project. Everyone in the group will sit around a compute and each person will be responsible for explaining a function or feature of your project and how you tested it. We are checking to see if the entire group understand how your project works

#### Team Work ####
Work together. We will be checking to see if everyone is contributing an equal amount. This grade goes both ways. If one person is doing all of the work, everyone will lose points, the same as if one person wasn't doing work. You need to work together as a team. 

#### Individual Contribution ####
At the end of the project we will send out a survey for you to answer about the class, your project, and your teammates contributions. Your score in this category will be based on what your teammates say about you. 

#### Rubric ####
* **10 points:** Implementation and version control
* **10 points:** Testing and Verification
* **10 points:** Code review
* **5 points:** Team Work
* **5 points:** Individual Contribution
