# Lab 8: Hashing and Sorting #
This lab focuses on two separate topics, the first being hashing and the second being sorting. Up until now, you have been doing exhaustive searching, where you have had to go to every item in your data structure in order to find something you were looking for. Well there is a better way to do random access. You can instead use a data structure called a hash table, that stores objects in an array, but places them in the array based on the output of a function. 

You will also be implementing two very important sorting functions this week. Bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort are nor the most efficient sorting algorithm around, with all of those having a running time of n^2. We want something that goes quite a bit faster. Some very smart people decades ago found some great great algorithms. You will be implementing two of them; quicksort and merge sort. Both of these will be using your `doubly_linked_list` from lab 6, so make sure that that is fully working.

### Lab Instructions ###

More information on the hash table will be added later this week. 

Implement both merge sort and quicksort. Verify they sort. We will only provide basic tests. You must implement the sorts though.
